        title: "Bone Mimicking",
        description: "Our innovative fully 3D printed lattice implants mimic the porous trabecular structure of bone, allowing natural load transfer through the knee that diminishes the negative effect of stress shielding. This allows for healthier bone in the long term, leading to increased patient satisfaction and a higher quality of life.",
