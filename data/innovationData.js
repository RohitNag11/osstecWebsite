        title: "Stiffness Matched to Bone",
        description: "Our innovative fully 3D printed lattice implants mimic the porous trabecular structure of bone, allowing natural load transfer through the knee that <b>diminishes the negative effect of stress shielding</b>. This allows for healthier bone in the long term, leading to increased patient satisfaction and a higher quality of life.",
